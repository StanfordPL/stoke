Subject: tests: fix false failure in nohup.sh in non tty builds

* tests/misc/nohup.sh: When running tests without a controlling tty,
an exec failure is triggered in a subshell, which causes POSIX
shells to immediately exit the subshell.  This was brought
to notice by the newly conforming bash 4.3.
Fixes http:/bugs.gnu.org/16940
