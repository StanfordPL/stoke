Controller for "regions" that are specified using instruction counts. Use -regions:in regions.csv<p>
regions.csv files will be an alternative to PinPoints files. The main goal is to separate warm-up specification from region description. Another major goal is the simplicity of implementation.<p>
Regions are specified using a text file with the records of the form: comment,thread-id,region-id,simulation-region-start-icount,simulation-region-end-icount,region-weight<p>
[ fields after the first six are ignored, so are lines beginning with '#' ]<p>
Knobs: ------ -regions:in foo.csv : input file -regions:warmup N : use N instructions for warmup -regions:prolog N : use N instructions for prolog -regions:epilog N : use N instructions for epilog -regions:verbose : for getting informed about regions/events -regions:overlap-ok : allow overlap among multiple regions. -regions:out : Output file for regions skipped due to overlap (if overlap is not ok) The idea is to feed this file with "-regions:in" to the next invocation of the tool to process skipped regions. If this knob is specified but no regions are skipped, the output file will be empty.<p>
Region processing: ----------------- The overall regions picture looks as follows: WARMUP--PROLOG--(SIM)REGION--EPILOG<p>
each sub-region has a start and end event. So there are eight events possible (some coinciding e.g. warmup-end and prolog-start) CONTROL_WARMUP_START : Beginning of warmup region CONTROL_WARMUP_STOP : End of warmup region CONTROL_PROLOG_START : Beginning of prolog region CONTROL_PROLOG_STOP : End of prolog region CONTROL_START : Beginning of interval CONTROL_STOP : End of interval CONTROL_EPILOG_START : Beginning of epilog region CONTROL_EPILOG_STOP : End of epilog region<p>
Using the warmup/prolog/epilog knobs provided to the controller, the region boundaries for the four sub-regions above are computed for each record in the regions.csv file.<p>
If overlap is not allowed (-regions:overlap-ok is zero), any record that has any of its 4 sub-regions overapping with any sub-region of previously processed records will be ignored. If -regions:out knob is specified, the skipped records will be output to a file. The idea is to feed the skipped region records to another invocation of the tool involved iteratively till all the records are processed.<p>
As regions are processed, an event list containing tuples of the form (icount, event-type, region-pointer) is created per thread. There is one tuple for each of the possible 8 events for four sub-regions. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Thu Dec 26 02:10:27 2013 for Pin by&nbsp;
